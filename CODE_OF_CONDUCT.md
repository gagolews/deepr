Code of Conduct
===============

This is a project conveyed in its author's free time.
It will most likely pass unnoticed, but if you happen to find it useful,
informative, amusing, or stimulating, I am happy for you.

Please read this book's introductory part for an overview of the philosophy
it implements; maybe it already addresses your concerns. Also, give
yourself some time, some ideas might just not be obvious at first glance.

Most likely, if I wrote X, came up with an assumption Y, or made a design
choice Z, there have been strong reasons for it. Try to find them yourself.

I am generally quite busy and might have no time to reply to queries
which have been clarified herein or in other easily accessible references;
seeking answers on your own will help you become more independent;
this is how we all learn, after all.

Any bug/typos reports/fixes are appreciated, as well as interesting and
non-trivial remarks that could lead to the improvement of the presented
material or my learning something noteworthy. Please use the
[*Issues*](https://github.com/gagolews/deepr/issues)
tracker to notify me about these.

Please spread the news about this project.

Good luck!
